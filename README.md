<h1>Pathfinding</h1>
This is a sample implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in a simple java engine. This was made for a bit of fun so there may be a few bugs and the engine is very simple. You can still use the code from it, but it may not be the best code ever.

You can use any of this code. The actual A* algorithm is hopefully fairly optimized.
