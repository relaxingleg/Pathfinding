<h1>Pathfinding</h1>
This is a sample implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in a simple java engine. This was made for a bit of fun so there may be a few bugs and the engine is very simple. You can still use the code from it, but it may not be the best code ever.
<br><br>
You can use any of this code. The actual A* algorithm is hopefully fairly optimized.

I would also like to say to make sure you don't make the pathfinding calculations only calculate one cell a frame like I have. This is purely to make it look better and more of a useful demo. If you want a fast pathfinding algorithm, just do it all in one go.
